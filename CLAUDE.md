- This is a Rust port of kodkod from Java. The reference source is in ../kodkod. It should always be used to verify functionality and implementation.
- The Java impl is the reference,
and the Rust port must be *complete*, *accurate* and *faithful*. *DO NOT* leave stubs, placeholders, mocks, simplifications or any
other workarounds.
